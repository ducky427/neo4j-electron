        <p>
          Because of how web browsers handle (self signed) certificates 
          the web browser needs to go to a HTTPS URL and accept / permanently 
          trust the certificate before a secure Bolt connection to the server can be 
          created.
        </p>
        <p>By default Neo4j offers a HTTPS URL on <a href="https://localhost:7473">https://localhost:7473</a>.</p>
        <p>
          You will need to manually view (usually by clicking in a broken padlock in
          the address bar) and trust the certificate to be able to create a secure connection.
